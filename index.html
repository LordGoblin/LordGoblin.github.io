    		<h1>This is the best motherfucking website.</h1>
    		<p>Really, it is.</p>

    		<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
    		<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
    		<p><span class="wrong">wrong</span>, motherfucker.</p>

    		<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
    		<p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>:</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
    			<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the Google home page</li>
    			<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
    			<li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
    			<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem well, kind of</li>
    			<li>It's accessible, so everyone can enjoy it but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</li>
    			<li>Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an ARPANET website</li>
    			<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use IPoAC</li>
    			<li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</li>
    			<li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
    			<li>Doesn't include any tracking service this website does, but hey, who cares</li>
    			<li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.</li>
    			<li>Use some fucking colors.</li>
    			<li>Links don't really need to keep that shitty blue the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited. Just give them a nice color</li>
    			
    		</ul>
